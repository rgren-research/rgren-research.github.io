## 👋 About Me

I am currently a researcher and system developer. 
My research interests include **computer vision**, **model compression**, and **efficient deep learning**.

Before that, I received my M.S. degree in Software Engineering and my B.E. degree in Computer Science.  
I am particularly interested in lightweight vision models and the practical deployment of deep neural networks, as well as interdisciplinary research areas such as artificial intelligence combined with biomedicine.
