## 👋 About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science.  
My research interests include **computer vision**, **model compression**, and **efficient deep learning**.

Before that, I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science and my B.E. degree in Computer Science.  
I am particularly interested in lightweight vision models and practical deployment of deep neural networks.
